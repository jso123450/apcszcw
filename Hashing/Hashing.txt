Hashing / Hash Tables
- we want to store things in a table by index (array)
- we have to take a unique ID and convert it into a table index to store it
- hash function h(x) is a mapping function
  it takes a piece of information and converts it into an index to our hash table
  ie. OSIS #s
      h(x) = x % 10,000 (converts OSIS to a 4 digit index)
      h(x) = 7 (v. nice hash function)

Problem: Clash/Collision
- multiple objects can hash to the same slot/index
- Resolutions
  - hash table's array has to be sufficiently large (sparsely populated)
  - hash function should do a good job distributing items in the table
